## Hello!ü§ù I am a software tester. I chose testing because I like to sort out the details and look for mistakes, and also because this specialty is associated with continuous learning and development. I am attentive to details, I can quickly adapt to new conditions, I have communication skills. I try to do my job efficiently, I'm not afraid of difficulties. If a situation arises, I always find a solution and immediately put it into practice.
